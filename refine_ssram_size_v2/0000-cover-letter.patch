Subject: [PATCH V2 0/2] refine the hard-coded GPA SSRAM area size

The GPA SSRAM area size in pre-launched VMs was hard-coded to 8MB.
Since this area is mapped from host SSRAM area, it will cause compile
problem when host's SSRAM area is larger than 8MB.

patch1 extracts the host's SSRAM area info into board file, and uses it
to generate guest's SSRAM area config that fits its actual size.

patch2 modifies the hard-coded SSRAM size in HV.

v2:
  1. Since SSRAM info is in each cache entry, sssram area info is not
necessary to be extracted in board_inspector. Now it only extracts ctl bin
info. The SSRAM area info is calculated in gpa.py.
  2. Pass PRE_RTVM_SW_SRAM_MAX_SIZE to HV, remove START/END.
  3. Fixed a bug that SOS removes GPA of SSRAM from ept(should be HPA).
  4. To align with config_tools and ACPI RTCT table, Host SSRAM area size
in HV now contains ctl bin.
  5. Refined the SSRAM mem layout info in gpa.py.

Tracked-On: #7212
